# Installation

## Stable release

To install, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}
```

or

```bash
conda install -c {{ cookiecutter.conda_channel }} {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}
```

This is the preferred method to install, as it will always install the most
recent stable release.

## From sources
